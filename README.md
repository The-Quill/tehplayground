Teh Playground
==============

Teh Playgound is a PHP testbed, where you can do rapid PHP prototyping without the need to build your own LAMP stack or bother with saving files and the like.
It allows you to slap together a quick block of code and render it straight in your browser, and even proceed to send that data over to a friend or colleague for collaboration.

Usage
-----

Just download the code however you'd like to, pop it in a webserver that supports PHP, edit the RENDER_PATH constant in bootstrap.php and browse to it.
